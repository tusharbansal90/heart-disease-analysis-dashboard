# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI Dashboard** for analyzing clinical data of heart disease patients.  
The purpose is to explore **patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators** to uncover insights about risk factors and their relationship with **mortality (death events)**.  

The dashboard provides **interactive visualizations** that help in identifying trends, patterns, and high-risk groups among patients.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives / Purpose
- Understand the **age and gender distribution** of patients.  
- Analyze the impact of **risk factors** (smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, anaemia).  
- Explore the effect of **clinical measures** like ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and serum sodium on mortality.  
- Provide insights into **survival rates over time**.  
- Build an easy-to-use dashboard for **data-driven decision making**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI** → Data cleaning, modeling, and dashboard creation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** → For calculated measures (e.g., % of deaths)  
- **Power Query** → Data transformation  
- **GitHub** → Version control and project showcase

## 📊 Data Source
The dataset contains clinical records of heart failure patients with the following columns:  
- `age` → Patient’s age  
- `anaemia` → Presence of anaemia (Yes/No)  
- `creatinine_phosphokinase` → Enzyme level  
- `diabetes` → Presence of diabetes  
- `ejection_fraction` → % of blood leaving the heart at each contraction  
- `high_blood_pressure` → Hypertension indicator  
- `platelets` → Platelet count  
- `serum_creatinine` → Creatinine level in blood  
- `serum_sodium` → Sodium level in blood  
- `sex` → Male / Female  
- `smoking` → Smoking habit  
- `time` → Follow-up period (days)  
- `DEATH_EVENT` → Mortality (1 = Died, 0 = Survived)

## 🌟 Features / Highlights
✔️ Age distribution and gender breakdown of patients  
✔️ Mortality rate analysis (% of patients died)  
✔️ Risk factor comparisons (smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, anaemia)  
✔️ Clinical measures impact (ejection fraction, creatinine, sodium)  
✔️ Survival trends over time  
✔️ Interactive filters for deep dive analysis  
✔️ Multiple visualizations: Card, Pie, Column, Line, and Scatter plots

## 📌 Insights (Sample)
- Patients with **low ejection fraction** had significantly higher mortality.  
- **Higher serum creatinine** was strongly correlated with deaths.  
- Majority of deaths occurred in **older patients (60+ years)**.  
- Lifestyle factors like **smoking and diabetes** increased risks, but clinical indicators had stronger influence.
